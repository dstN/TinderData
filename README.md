### Usage

Just put the Code into repl.it or run it locally with a `data.json` in the same directory as the `script.py`

### How to get your tinder data?

Go to [Data | account.gotinder.com](https://account.gotinder.com/data) and request your data with your login credentials.

### Where is the data.json?

After you requested your Tinder Data it takes some days or weeks to get your data, after you downloaded your data you have a file in your directory called `myData.zip` if you unpack this you get your `data.json` which you have to put in the same directory as the `script.py` before your run the script.
